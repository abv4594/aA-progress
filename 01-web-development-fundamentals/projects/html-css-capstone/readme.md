# Capstone Project HTML/CSS 

## About

This project is part of the program App Academy Open under the p1xt cohort. 

## Background

I have been studied HTML/CSS in the past but I had to come back and review the concepts. To speed up the process, I have looked into p1xt solution and used it as a base. However, I have done the code myself and used in many cases different strategies. 

## What I want to improve

The contact form is definitely not good enough. I also had challenges in understanding what cascades and what doesn't (for instance, defining the font color at body level doesn't seem to cascade to <a> tag).

Overall, I need to get more practice in building websites using HTML/CSS.
